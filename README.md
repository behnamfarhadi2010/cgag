# Newfoundland Coast Guard Art Gallery
## The Challenge:
Visitors at the Coast Guard Alumni NL Museum often wanted to dive deeper into the stories behind the art prints and historical displays—but traditional plaques and labels could only share so much.

### The Solution:
We designed an interactive website that bridges the physical and digital museum experience:

1. QR Code Integration: Every art print now has a scannable QR code.

2. Instant Access to Rich Content: Visitors can:

      Watch engaging videos about the artwork’s history and significance.
      
      Browse additional historical photos and documents related to the piece.
      
      Listen to firsthand accounts or expert commentary.

## The Story Behind the Project
On the rugged cliffs of Newfoundland and Labrador, where Atlantic storms batter the coast, lighthouses once stood as beacons of hope—guiding ships through fog and darkness. But time and progress have left many of these sentinels abandoned, forgotten, or demolished.

An artist set out on a mission: to paint all 74 lighthouses along the coast, preserving their legacy before they vanished. Today, their original prints hang in a small museum near Cape Spear, the easternmost point of North America.


# Designing with Heritage: The Coast Guard Colors 

Like the uniform of a seasoned mariner, our interface wears the **deep navy** and **gold** of the official Coast Guard emblem. These aren't just colors—they're a tribute:


### Main Color Scheme  
| Role       | Hex       | 
|------------|-----------|
| Navy       | `#003366` | 
| Gold       | `#FFD700` | 

Every pixel honors the Coast Guard's legacy while ensuring modern readability.
