# Newfoundland Coast Guard Art Gallery

## The Story Behind the Project

On the rugged cliffs of Newfoundland and Labrador, where Atlantic storms batter the coast, lighthouses once stood as beacons of hope—guiding ships through fog and darkness. But time and progress have left many of these sentinels abandoned, forgotten, or demolished.

An artist set out on a mission: to paint all 74 lighthouses along the coast, preserving their legacy before they vanished. Today, their original prints hang in a small museum near Cape Spear, the easternmost point of North America.

# Designing with Heritage: The Coast Guard Colors

Like the uniform of a seasoned mariner, our interface wears the **deep navy** and **gold** of the official Coast Guard emblem. These aren't just colors—they're a tribute:

### Main Color Scheme

| Role | Hex       |
| ---- | --------- |
| Navy | `#003366` |
| Gold | `#FFD700` |

Every pixel honors the Coast Guard's legacy while ensuring modern readability.
